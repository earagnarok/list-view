<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Ulthwe list is similar to the Epic UK list, focused around the Black Guardian squads. The Black
    Guardians benefit from the price drop on Wave Serpents, and in addition the option to replace Wave Serpent with
    Falcons and more importantly Firestorms has been added. The Black Guardians also have a 1+ Initiative Rating, making
    the list in general more reliable.

    The Ulthwe list also has access to a new unit, the Wraith Knights. Eldar Wraith Knight are fast and have a 1+
    activation with various weapon options making them an interesting option for triggering engages with Guardians in
    support.

    The option to take Firestorms with the Mounted Black Guardian Warhost has been removed, as these made the formation a bit too strong.
