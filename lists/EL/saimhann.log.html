<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    EAR:Saim-Hann is mostly based on the Epic UK list, but has seen a few additions and changes. The idea is still to have an army with quite a lot of Jetbikes, but the addition of Mounted Guardians in the core section gives som additional options, especially since this formation can also take a Firestorm as an upgrade.

    Another very interesting addition to the list is the "Wind-Swift" special rule, which can also be found in lists such as White Scars and Dark Eldar. It gives the list an even more mobile feel than other Eldar lists. This rule works really well with the new unit "Saim-Hann Shroud Runners" which replaces Eldar Rangers in the list.

    Finally, the Revenants has the "Independent Twins" special rule, allowing it to be taken as two separate formations. This simple change makes the formation both more flexible and plays very differently from a normal pair.
