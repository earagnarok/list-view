<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The Exodites list based on a NetEA developmental list originally designed by Raundall. We have done several major changes to the list to align and balance it compared to other EA:Ragnar√∂k lists. While keeping many of the typical Eldar traits, such as Hit and Run, Webway Portals, Farsight and an Avatar (in this list called an Eternal Drake), the Exodites list is quite different compared to other Eldar lists. It generally is less fragile, while losing some of the speed and ranged capabilities of many of the other Eldar lists.

<p>
    The Exodites does not have the restriction on garrisoning that other Eldars have, which makes their Militia units more flexible than Eldar Guardians. They can be used to hold terrain already from the first activation, or boosted with heavy weapon platforms to gain powerful ranged attacks. Since the Militia formations also includes a character with Farsight they can also be used to summon the Eternal Drake in an interesting position already in turn one.

    The Exodites has been given access to Corsairs allies which comes with air-assaults, fighters and other interesting options. They also have access to the older variant of Eldar Knights as allies.
