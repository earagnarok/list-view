<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Space Wolves list is based on the NetEA/EpicUK original with a number of organizational and formation changes to differentiate the list further from the Codex Astartes. The Space Wolves army is focused on infantry and engagements and the chapter special rules has been redesigned to give the Space Wolves a unique playstyle where they benefit from working together to defeat the enemy.
</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Thunderwolf Cavalry is a new unit/formation added to the list. They are fairly fast and packs a heavy punch in close combat.</li>
    <li>The Fenrisian Wolves are no longer available as a formation, but can instead be added as upgrades to a number of formations.</li>
    <li>The Thunderhaws has been replaced by the chapter unique Stormwolf Assault Boat.</li>
    <li>Space wolves has been given access to Leman Russ Exterminators, in tribute of their Primarch</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Space Wolves list is flexible when it comes to deployment options (ground, space and air) and very strong in engagements. But if you are not careful you can end up with an army where most formations are very weak when it comes to shooting and might not even be able to place blastmarkers. The core and elite packs are very powerful, but consider adding support packs for some ranged firepower. Also, plan ahead when you deploy and move your formations to be able to make the best use of your <i>Extended Command</i> and <i>Pack Mentality</i> abilities.
