<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Word Bearers list is mostly a clean sheet design. It is Undivided with much in common with Black Legion. It is an attempt to create a mix of Chaos Space Marine units with a significant share of cultist units and daemon engines.

<p>
    Since this combination tend to become quite powerful, a number of things have been removed when compared to the EAR Black Legion list. Primarily Dreadclaws and Titans, but also Cult Marines which has been replaced with Daemonkin.

<p>
   Word Bearers have access to many powerful garrison formations, and is very good at rallying due to the Heralds of Truth special rule, which has led to it being nerfed to a 3 in Strategy Rating.
