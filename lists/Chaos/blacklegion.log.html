<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Black Legion list is based on the NetEA version. Black Legion is one of the most powerful armies in Epic Armageddon, and it still is, but the changes will hopefully open it up to more playstyles. Below are the more significant changes.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Anti-Air</b>: Black Legion previously only had Obliterators as their sole ground AA unit, which by its nature caused certain formations to very common. To open up the playstyle a bit the Chaos Stalker has been added to most CSM armies, while Obliterators can be taken as part of the Chaos Terminators formation.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Factions</b>: All factions except Undivied have been removed from the list, but due to the more balanced lesser daemons, they now cost 1 point to summon.
</p>
<h5>Additional nerfs, boosts & tweaks</h5>
<ul>

    <li>Black Legion Characters can only join Chaos Space Marines, Havocs, Raptors, Chaos Assault Bikes, or Chaos Terminators units.</li>
    <li>The Havocs and Cult Marines upgrades do no longer add to formation size by replacing CSM units. This makes the upgrades more attractive by making them significantly cheaper.</li>
    <li>The Armoured Company has been moved to the Support Section.</li>
    <li>Chosen are now forced to take Rhinos, but can replace these with Chaos Dreadnoughts. </li>
    <li>The Harbringer has been removed from the list.</li>
    <li>The Decimator has had its FF value reduced to 5+.</li>
    <li>The Doom Wheel is in most ways better than a Chaos Warhound, and is therefore 25 points more expensive.</li>
    <li>The Chaos Warhounds have been reduced to 25cm speed, in line with other Warhound type units in the game.</li>
    <li>The Chaos Reaver and Warlord replaces the Khorne-type Titans that Black Legion had, but have essentially the same weapons. They inherit the type of changes that has been made to titans elsewhere in the game.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    The Decimator is still a bit too powerful for its points, so the Decimator Cannon has been reduced to 30cm in range, while its FF has been boosted to 3+.
