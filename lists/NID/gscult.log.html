<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Cult of the Rusted Claw list is built from scratch by the EA:Ragnarok team. The rigid structure of
    the list represents an army made up of units from all stages of the Genestealer infection cycle, where access to
    Neophytes and Imperial Guard technology are limited by the number of Acholyte Hybrids. The mining theme of the
    Genestealer Cult has been further emphasized in the list by introducing two mining-themed War Engines. The leaders
    of the cult are important and powerful. The list has access to cheap and powerful characters, but the downside is
    that if you lose the Patriarch formation the enemy captures the BTS victory condition (see the Broodcoven special
    rule).
</p>
<p>
    The list is designed to play as a hoard army excelling in close combat. It has good mobility with cheap access to
    multiple transport options for the core formations and several fast moving formations. The addition of stolen
    Imperial Guard technology also adds some firepower. The downside to the list is that many of the units are very
    fragile, with little to no armor, and are not very good in firefights. Expect to lose formations while you close in
    on the enemy, and find the right balance between the number of activations in your army and the punch each formation
    can deliver.

<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>Some small nerfs, boosts & tweaks</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ridgerunners are moved from Support to Elite, as they were hard to fit in with the very competitive support section.</li>
    <li>Aberrants have got 4+ Armour, as they felt quite weak, and had oddly low save compared to e.g. Ogryns or Big Mutants in other lists.</li>
    <li>The Assault Excavator feels a bit too weak, so it now has 4+ CC.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>As part of general Tyranid changes the Genestealer Swarm has received a 25 points price drop. We felt that this price drop was fair also for the Genestealer Cult, as this list needed a small boost to its power-level</p>
