<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnarök Hive Fleet Hydra Tyranid is an alternative Tyranid army themed around the concept of swarming. The list has kept the structure with synapse and instinctive swarms but has a different playstyle compared to the Dagon list. The Hydra list can swarm gaunts to boost the strength of its swarms, and also has creatures that can assist the swarming. The idea of swarming originates from the NetEA Tyranid list, but we wanted to simplify the process of swarming and also associate a cost to it so the rule is quite different compared to the NetEA version.
</p>
<p>
    Another difference from the Dagon list, which was the original EA:Ragnarök Tyranid list, is that the Hydra list is a bit more shooty than the Dagon list. A number of bioforms that are primarily ranged focused has been added to the list such as: Pyrovores, Hive Guards and Tyrannofexes. In return the list does not have access to e.g. Hierodules and Haruspexes.
</p>
<p>
    Compared to the Dagon list the Hive fleet Hydra has lost access to Spaceships and Tunnelers limiting their options when it comes to deployment, to balance the powerful swarming ability.
</p>
<p>
    During the development of the Hydra list, a number of existing Tyranid bioforms and swarms has been changed to achieve a better internal balance. If you are interested in the details have a look at the Hive Fleet Dagon change log.

<h4>Version 1.0.beta-4</h4>
<p>We still felt that the Tyranid lists needed more activations so the price for some formations has been reduced.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The cost for Genestealer Swarms was reduced by 25 points.</li>
    <li>Harridans can now be taken without instinctive swarms.</li>
</ul>
