<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Hive Fleet Dagon Tyranid list is heavily influenced by the F-ERC Tyranids, in particular the army structure, but with plenty of inspiration drawn from the NetEA and E-UK versions as well. Some key aspects are the absence of a Swarm rule (though this could appear in other Tyranid lists), and an adapted version of the Super-Expendable rule from E-UK.
</p>
<p>
    One of the main features of the list is that Synapse creatures are usually possible to target separately from the surrounding formation, making it possible to decapitate these formations, giving them a number of penalties to activation etc. Such 'headless' swarms can be absorbed into other swarms with remaining synapse creatures.
</p>
<p>
    The structure of the Dagon Tyranid list is one of its main features, making it possible to be very creative with formation composition. It has been a challenge to make it attractive to not only take basic Assault Swarms, though that is certainly a viable army to take.

<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    The Dactylis has been found to be a bit weak, so have been reduced by 25pts.
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-3</h4>
<p>
    After finding that the list struggles with activations, Assault Swarms have been changed to one or two instinctive swarms, and a new type of Gaunt has been added: Barbgaunts.
</p>
    Bio-Titans have been found to be too expensive to take in a competitive lists, so have been reduced in DC and cost.
<p>
    <br>To give the list some extra options in playstyle, the restrictions on garrisons have been dropped, which resulted in the following changes:
    <br>Zoanthropes have become slightly better and are now an 25 point upgrade to Tyranid Warriors.
    <br>Carnifexes have been dropped to 2 per swarm, been given 15cm speed and the Infiltators special rule. Barbed Carnifexes have been given an extra attack i CC, but been dropped to 4+ to hit.
    <br>Trygons have been given a slight boost, hitting on 3+ i CC.
    <br>The Harpy Stranglethorn Cannon have been boosted to 30cm in range.
