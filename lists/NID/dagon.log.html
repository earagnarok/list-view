<h4>Version 1.0.beta</h4>
<p>
    The EA:Ragnar√∂k Hive Fleet Dagon Tyranid list is heavily influenced by the F-ERC Tyranids, in particular the army structure, but with plenty of inspiration drawn from the NetEA and E-UK versions as well. Some key aspects are the absence of a Swarm rule (though this could appear in other Tyranid lists), and an adapted version of the Super-Expendable rule from E-UK.
</p>
<p>
    One of the main features of the list is that Synapse creatures are usually possible to target separately from the surrounding formation, making it possible to decapitate these formations, giving them a number of penalties to activation etc. Such 'headless' swarms can be absorbed into other swarms with remaining synapse creatures.
</p>
<p>
    The structure of the Dagon Tyranid list is one of its main features, making it possible to be very creative with formation composition. It has been a challenge to make it attractive to not only take basic Assault Swarms, though that is certainly a viable army to take.

<h4>Version 1.0.beta-2</h4>
<p>
    The Dactylis has been found to be a bit weak, so have been reduced by 25pts.
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-3</h4>
<p>
    After finding that the list struggles with activations, Assault Swarms have been changed to one or two instinctive swarms to reduce price. To give the list some extra options in playstyle, the restrictions on garrisons have been dropped, which resulted in the following changes:
    <ul>
        <li>Barbgaunts has been added to the list. They are a type of gaunt with 15cm movement and shooting, meaning they can be used as garrisons.</li>
        <li>Zoanthropes have become slightly better, since they can now garrison along with some gaunts, and are now an 25 point upgrade to Tyranid Warriors. They have also been given a boost to their FF to justify the extra points.</li>
        <li>Carnifexes have been dropped to 2 per swarm, been given 15cm speed and the Infiltators special rule. Barbed Carnifexes have been given an extra attack i CC, but been dropped to 4+ to hit.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Some other minor changes to list balance:
    <ul>
        <li>The Exocrines did not see much playtime, and has been given MW to their FF value making them a powerful firefight and support unit.</li>
        <li>Bio-Titans have been found to be too expensive to take in a competitive lists, so have been reduced in DC and cost.</li>
        <li>Hive Nests have been changed in line with how they work in the Hive Fleet Hydra list, with no compulsory gaunts. Ripper Swarms have been boosted to give both extra CC and FF attacks.</li>
        <li>Trygons have been given a slight boost, hitting on 3+ i CC.</li>
        <li>The Harpy Stranglethorn Cannon have been boosted to 30cm in range.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Version 1.0.beta-4</h4>
<p>We still felt that the Tyranid lists, and in particular Hive Fleet Dagon needed more activations so the price for some formations has been reduced.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The cost for Breacher Swarms and Genestealer Swarms was reduced by 25 points.</li>
    <li>Harridans can now be taken without instinctive swarms, and has been given Tentaclids to give the army another option for AA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the changed that were made as part of introducing Hive Fleet Hydra did not work well with the Hive Fleet Dagon Mycetic Spore option. You could drop very small formations with basically only synapse creatures, which felt wrong. The Mycetic Spore has been changed from an Instinctive Swarm to a regular upgrade option to fix the problem.</p>
