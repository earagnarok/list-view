    The EA:Ragnarök Elysian Drop Troops army is designed by the EA:Ragnarök team with some inspiration from the Epic UK Vanaheim list. The Elysians has a unique playstyle compared to other Imperial Guard lists with focus on airborne assault infantry regiments. Their combat doctrine is reflected in the list by the specialized airborne companies, and the lack of heavy support tanks. As a unique feature of the list, and to further emphasize the Elysian playstyle, they were given the powerful ability to deploy formations in a spaceship and transport them onto the battlefield using <i>Planetfall</i>.

    The Elysians has access to the full range of Imperial Navy aircrafts and because of their exceptional pilots have special rules that makes the aircrafts more reliable as well as being able to start the game on CAP. The downside is that the army lacks ground-based anti-air and must rely on their fighters to deter attacking enemy aircrafts.

    The Drop Troop Companies are the back-bone of your army. They are very flexible, fast and perform well both in assaults and from a distance. If you keep them supported and protected they can win you the battle. You can get quite a lot of activations with this list, but many of your cheap activations are fragile and can easily be destroyed. You need to find a balance between activations and staying power in your formations, and also think about how you will handle large tanky enemy formations or large war engines...
