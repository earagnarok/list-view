No Shrikes of any type may be taken. After the Mycetic Spore lands, it attacks all enemy units within 15cm.

Then transported formations set up within 5cm of the point the Mycetic Spore landed, or within 5cm of another already disembarqued unit from the same formation (but a maximum of 15cm from the point where the Mycetic Spore landed)."
